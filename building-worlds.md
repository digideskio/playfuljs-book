# Playful JavaScript
## Building Digital Worlds

### 1. Introduction

This is a book about breathing life into imaginary places.

If you learn something about design patterns, algorithms, or data structures along the way,
I apologize and assure you it's purely coincidental.
If you're looking for math, you've come to the wrong place.
I suck at math, so we'll squeak by with the minimum amount necessary.

We'll use JavaScript, the language of the web, because if you build something cool in JS it's easy to share with your friends.
It's also reasonably fast and very high-level, so we can express big ideas with just a little code.
Some of our examples will also use specific JavaScript tools like Canvas or WebGL.

However, this book is really about *ideas* -
simple, elegant ideas that generate beautiful results.
Such ideas are not bound to any specific language or tool.
In fact, most are older than JavaScript itself.
