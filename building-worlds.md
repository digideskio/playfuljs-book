# Playful JavaScript
## Building Worlds

### 1. Introduction

This is a book about breathing life into imaginary places.

It uses JavaScript, the language of the web.
If you build something cool in JS, it's easy to share with your friends.
It's also reasonably fast and very high-level, so we can express big ideas with just a little code.
Some of our examples will also use specific JavaScript tools like Canvas or WebGL.

However, this book is really about *ideas* -
simple, elegant ideas that generate beautiful complexity.
Such ideas are not bound to any specific language or tool.
In fact, most are older than JavaScript itself.
