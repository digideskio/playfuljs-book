# Playful JavaScript
## Building Procedural Worlds

### 1. Introduction

This is a book about breathing life into imaginary places.

Procedural generation allows a programmer to create endless interactive, 3D environments
without any background in art, modeling, or animation.
As the size of environments in games, movies, and other media increases,
content creators are turning more and more to procedural methods. 

This books explores fun, playful, and visual algorithms - with the absolute minimum math necessary.
If you learn something about design patterns or data structures along the way,
I apologize and assure you it's purely coincidental.

We'll use JavaScript, the language of the web, because if you build something cool in JS it's easy to share with your friends.
It's also reasonably fast and very high-level, so we can express big ideas with just a little code.
Some of our examples will also use specific JavaScript tools like Canvas or WebGL.

However, this book is really about *ideas* -
simple, elegant ideas that generate beautiful results.
Such ideas are not bound to any specific language or tool.
In fact, most are older than JavaScript itself.
